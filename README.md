Augmenting selection bias modelling with machine learning for big speedups.

The methodology behind this package is introduced in [Chapman-Bird et. al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad1397) for the specific case of modelling selection biases in extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) populations. If you use this package in your work, please cite this paper **and** the [code package doi](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7573034).
